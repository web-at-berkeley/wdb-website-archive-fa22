      'The main reason I wanted to join WDB at first was purely because I had never really gotten the chance to dabble in web development, and I thought this would be a great opportunity for me to actually nail down the fundamentals and then transition into working hands-on on projects, something that’s pretty unique to WDB. Later on I realized a lot of the friends I’ve made at Berkeley have been through this club, WDB has been a really important part of my Berkeley experience thus far :)',
