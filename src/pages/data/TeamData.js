			'Hey there! My name is Samarth and I am studying Computer Science and Business Administration. Web Development has been a huge passion of mine, and the lack of advanced web dev education on Berkeley’s campus is a problem I’ve long wanted to solve, and I hope to do so with Web Dev @ Berkeley! Besides coding, I practice martial arts, practice guitar, and play the drums in the cal band.',

After four years of teaching a technical field, I’ve grown passionate about educating the future generation of engineers and computer scientists. When I’m not busy teaching backend web development, cloud technologies, data structures, data science, or bioengineering, you can catch me at marching band performances or drinking boba somewhere!',

			'Hi everyone, I am a second-year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I recently got into Web Development after attending a hackathon, and I believe that it is an extremely valuable topic that is not extensively covered in Berkeley’s current CS curriculum. I am also very passionate about UI/UX Design, and I am excited to teach others these skills as well. Outside of coding and staring at screens, I am an avid photographer, videographer, and dancer. I enjoy making Youtube videos in my free time, so as they say, like and subscribe, and go bears!',

			'Hello! I am an EECS major from Arcadia, a city close to Los Angeles. I first got into computer science through video games, when I used to play with the Unity3D game engine and Skyrim mods. Since then, I’ve had a variety of interests in computer science, one of which is web development! Outside of the world of computers, I’m also in TBD Comedy, an improv comedy team here at UC Berkeley. My other interests include playing the electric bass guitar, ludology, studying philosophy, and reading science fiction.',
