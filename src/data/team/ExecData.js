			"Hey there! My name is Samarth, and I'm a student at UC Berkeley from the Chicago area studying Computer Science and Business Administration. Web Development has been a huge passion of mine, and the lack of advanced web dev education on Berkeley’s campus is a problem I’ve long wanted to solve, and I hope to do so with Web Dev @ Berkeley! Besides coding, I practice martial arts, practice guitar, and play the drums in the cal band.",

			'Hi everyone, I am a second-year Computer Science major. I first encountered the wonderful world of web dev when cluelessly attending a hackathon and being bombarded with a bunch of stuff I didn’t know. I believe it’s a super rewarding and important topic that’s not extensively covered in Berkeley’s curriculum. I especially love web design and making sites look sexy. Outside of coding and staring at screens, I am an avid photographer and dancer. I enjoy making Youtube videos in my free time, so as they say, like and subscribe, and go bears!',
