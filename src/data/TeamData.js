Web Development has been a huge passion of mine, and the lack of advanced web dev education on Berkeley’s campus is a problem I’ve long wanted to solve, and I hope to do so with Web Dev @ Berkeley! Besides coding, I practice martial arts, practice guitar, and play the drums in the cal band.',

I believe it’s a super rewarding and important topic that’s not extensively covered in Berkeley’s curriculum. I especially love web design and making sites look sexy. Outside of coding and staring at screens, I am an avid photographer and dancer. I enjoy making Youtube videos in my free time, so as they say, like and subscribe, and go bears!',
